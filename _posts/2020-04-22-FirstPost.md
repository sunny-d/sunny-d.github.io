# Hello Readers!

These sure are strange times. I am currently in middle school. To do school during the quarintine, I have to attend zoom meetings and basically stay on my computer until 11 (am). 

Right now it's 9:43 pm, so I will go to sleep and continue probably tomorrow after school. I'm not sure.
